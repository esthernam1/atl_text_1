    alt="This is diverse hotpot setup from Liuyishou Hotpot in Boston. 
    Pictured is a fairly large metal pot divided into two curvacious sections that separate the flavorful soup bases. 
    One section is blood red with floating ingredients such as spicy peppers and mouth-numbing spices. Another is a milky bone broth that 
    houses less heat and more simplicity within it's taste. Surrounding the pot is a large ring of neatly folded, raw lamb meat–resembling 
    that of beef. "   width="50%"></div>
